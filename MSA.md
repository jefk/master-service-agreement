###Summary:

I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if stuff goes wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.

####In short:

You ([CLIENT COMPANY]) are hiring me ([MY COMPANY]) for software development. Of course it's a little more complicated, and the details of your specific project will be covered in an additional statement of work.

###What do both parties agree to do?

As my customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I need to complete the project including text, images and other information as and when I need it, and in the format that I ask for. You agree to review my work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out in the statement of work.

I have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from me and I will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way I will endeavor to meet all the deadlines set but I can't be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage. On top of this I will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.

###Getting down to the nitty gritty

####Billable hours
[define billable hours]

####Additional development
Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to in a statement of work (SOW) must be accompanied by an additional (SOW) which we will be happy to provide upon request. I retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in a SOW.

####Contact
All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9:30am-5:30pm eastern time, excluding holidays) and I will reply to communications within one business day (usually much quiker) unless I notify you ahead of time that I will be out of the office. Of course I understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case of one know that our hours will be billed at 1.5 times the rate specified in the SOW. I appreciate communication in a text-based medium, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. I’m happy to speak to you on the phone, over video chat, or in person if we are located in the same area.

###Legal stuff

Although we test extensively, we can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Phew.

####Copyrights

You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the application are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

You own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project. We will give you a copy of all files and you should store them safely as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that we used in making them.

You also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We own the code we produced and we retain the rights to license it how we choose or to contribute it back to the open source project which it is based on.
We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of our portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books as well as speak about them publicly at conferences. Of course we’re happy to keep this information to ourselves until your project goes live or 6 months from the handover date, whichever is sooner.

###Payments

We are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly.  As we're also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule.

####Payment Schedule

We bill every other week on Friday and all invoices are payable upon receipt.

A deposit of [DEPOSIT AMOUNT] is due up front and will be subtracted from the last invoice.

Any payments not received within 7 days will halt work until the payment is received. If payment is late twice during the project, we retain the right to ask for prepayment of hours or to end the project, whichever is deemed more fitting for the situation.

If either party chooses to end the project, it must be done in writing. Please keep in mind that the deposit will be forfeited and any work that has been paid for up to that point will be turned over to you.

###But where is all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of [MY STATE] courts.
