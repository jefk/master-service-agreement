###Summary:

I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if stuff goes wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.

####In short:

You ([CLIENT COMPANY]) are hiring me ([MY COMPANY]) for software development. Of course it's a little more complicated, and the details of your specific project will be covered in an additional statement of work.

###What do both parties agree to do?

As my customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I need to complete the project including text, images and other information as and when I need it, and in the format that I ask for. You agree to review my work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out in the statement of work.

I have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from me and I will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way I will endeavor to meet all the deadlines set but I can't be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage. On top of this I will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.

###Getting down to the nitty gritty

####Billable hours
I want the time that I am billing you for to be as productive as possible. I will bill for time that I am actively making software, designing solutions, learning about technologies that I will use in your project, or discussing the project with you.

####Additional development
Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to in a statement of work (SOW) must be accompanied by an additional SOW which I will be happy to provide upon request. I retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in a SOW that we have agreed to.

####Contact
All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9:30am-5:30pm eastern time, excluding holidays) and I will reply to communications within one business day (usually much quicker) unless I notify you ahead of time that I will be out of the office. Of course I understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case work needed outside regular business hours, know that our hours will be billed at 1.5 times the rate specified in the SOW. I appreciate communication in a text-based medium, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. I’m happy to speak to you on the phone, over video chat, or in person if we are located in the same area.

####Agile process
Together you and I will maintain a prioritized list of tasks that need to be completed by me. These tasks are small pieces of work that each deliver some incremental product value, and can be approved by you in a timely manner after completion. You will be available at least three hours a week, spread across three sessions, to review completed work, and plan for the upcoming set of tasks.

###Legal stuff

Although I test extensively, I can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Phew.

####Copyrights

You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the application are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When I receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

####What you own
You own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. You own the code that I produce during billable hours and that is in the scope of a SOW that we agreed to. If I am hosting any code or other assets, I am happy to work with you to transfer those assets.

####What I own
I retain the rights to any intangible assets created during the scope of your project. These intangible assets include ideas, system designs, and general purpose algorithms. You can certainly use these in your product. I grant you an irrevocable license to use these intangible assets for all time.

I love to show off my work and share what I have learned with other people, so I also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of my portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books as well as speak about them publicly. Of course I’m happy to keep this information to myself until your project goes live.

###Payments

I am sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly. As I'm also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tightly to the following payment schedule.

####Payment Schedule

We bill every other week on Friday and all invoices are payable upon receipt.

Any payments not received within 7 days will be considered late. Work will until the late payment is received. If a payment is late I have the right to withhold code or other work that hasn't been paid for, or to stop any serives such as website hosting I have set up for your project. If payment is late twice during the project, I retain the right to ask for prepayment of hours or to end the project, whichever is deemed more fitting for the situation.

If either party chooses to end the project, it must be done in writing. Please keep in mind that the deposit (if applicable) will be forfeited and any work that has been paid for up to that point will be turned over to you.

###But where is all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

In the case that this agreement, or any SOW under this agreement, is disputed, we agree to settle disputes in arbitration rather than court.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of New York courts.
