# Master Service Agreement
I use this agreement to define the contract software development relationship between me and my clients. It's main topics are how I interact with clients, intellectual property, and liability.

This agreement is designed to be generic, and usable for any client with minimal modification. Any project specific agreements can be added as a statement of work.

See [MSA.md](https://github.com/jefk/master-service-agreement/blob/master/MSA.md) for the details.
