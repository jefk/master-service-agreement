# Master Service Agreement
See [MSA.md](https://github.com/jefk/master-service-agreement/blob/master/MSA.md) for the details.

I use this agreement to define the contract software development relationship between me and my clients. It covers topics including:
* How I interact with clients
* Intellectual property
* Liability

This agreement is designed to be generic, and usable for any client with minimal modification. Any project specific agreements are added as a statement of work.
